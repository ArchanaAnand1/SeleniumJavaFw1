Dear Archangel Michel,

Thanks for all the belessins received.

Today, I am pushing thorugh a lot of difficult situations. But thabnks for the strength that you are providing me. 

I have a few prayer rquests:
1.Vidya should withdraw all her case and go away(She will get married this year)
2.My mother will utilise all the money that she got from her retirement(pension and finl settlement) to build our dream home
3.Love should find me. I want a peaceful and loved life. I want to be happy.

Please remember me in your prayers

Thanks Archangel,

With prayers,
Archana A
